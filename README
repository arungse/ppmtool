     # generates difference between images

  -s infile.ppm outfile.ppm bitdepth (8-16)
     # create new PPM image based on bit depth

  -z infile.ppm outfile.ppm zoomfactor (0.1-8.0)
     # create scaled image

  -c infile.ppm outfile.ppm arg_option (0:YUV from RGB, 1:RGB from YUV)
     # create YUV image from RGB or RGB image from YUV

  -b infile.ppm outfile.ppm arg_option (0:bayer from ppm, 1:ppm from bayer)
     # create bayer image from PPM or PPM image from bayer

LICENSE:
  I've made the license be MIT, but this is a quick hack and if you
  have some reason to want to use this where another license would be
  preferable, email me and we can discuss the issue. I will probably
  accommodate other alternatives in the very unlikely case that somebody
  actually cares.
